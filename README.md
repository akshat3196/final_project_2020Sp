Hypotheses Testing
Is there any positive correlation between Cannabis consumption and consumption of hard drugs, or these two variables are independent of each other?

In 3 countries who top alcohol consumption, majority of the heavy drinkers are whites.

People who consume nicotine, also consume alcohol regularly.

Regular users of cocaine are mostly students who have dropped out of high school or did not attend college.
